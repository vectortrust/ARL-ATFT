**Mission Statement**

My mission, my goal, is and always has been to love the **Creator** and love Julie, my wife, my mate, and everything else I want will be given to me. 

Breaking that down. It would seem at first blush to be two easy things to do. I think we know that truly loving anything other than ourselves is a herculean task.

I do a mediocre job of loving myself. I don't expend the amount of energy i should or need to daily to raise my awareness of my shortcomings and diligently find ways to either counter my bad habits or to just plain stop them altogether. I'm usually spending most of my time trying to obtain something that, if I were to have thought it out, I don't really want or need.

It is this that I would like to reduce in myself. This lack of thinking things through. If I were to spend a heartbeat more time, a second of meditation on what the knowledge really means, and then, armed with that knowledge and the peace of knowing that I'm not just using the magic eight-ball to make my decisions. I can make an informed choice about the action that I need to take in any of the thousands of decisions that I am confronted with daily. 

That was the long-winded way of saying this:

**My mission is to learn how to make informed decisions and that those informed decisions be for the betterment of myself, my mate, and the whole of my species.**

Reducing that down again would yield:

**Love myself enough to be useful to myself and others.**

Reducing yet again:

That **_I love_**.

To that end I have tried to employ as a tool this idea of true humility. As a virtue, it is the one that will hide the other virtues from you so you don't even know or think that you are virtuous. And in the end it hides itself. Truly a most profound virtue, better in my eyes than wisdom, which I hold in the highest esteem.

Stated in other terms:

**_My mission in life is: not to be a narcissistic prick and to love._**
