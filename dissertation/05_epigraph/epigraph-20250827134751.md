“**There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation.**”
—_Herbert Spencer_

“**A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.**”\
― _Frank Herbert_, Dune
