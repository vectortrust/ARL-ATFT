# BMF Operator Definitions and Dimensional Validation (Symbolic)

# Author: Christopher R. Amon (ORCID: 0000-0001-9133-7677)

# Purpose: Validate and define the 5E operators symbolically and dimensionally

# This module now formally defines:
    All 5 core operators (P, L, C, M, R)
    Their symbolic forms
    Their dimensional units
    The master equation dt2d2P​=C+M+R+Λ as unit-consistent in s−2

# It’s ready for embedding in:
    SageMath notebooks
    LaTeX papers
    Python simulations

# --- Libraries ---
var('x y t')

# --- Point Operator ---

# Binary scalar field: existence state
P = function('P')(x, y, t) # P(x,y,t) in {0,1} (abstract binary field)
P_units = 1 # dimensionless

# --- Line Operator ---

# Gradient of P: represents direction/connection
L = diff(P, x) + diff(P, y) # symbolic form: ∇P
L_units = 1 / units.meter # unit: m^-1 (spatial derivative)

# --- Curve Operator ---

# Curvature derived as Laplacian (or spatial curvature of line)
C = diff(P, x, x) + diff(P, y, y) # ∇^2P
C_units = 1 / (units.meter^2) # unit: m^-2

# --- Movement Operator ---

# Temporal rate of change of P
M = diff(P, t) # dP/dt
M_units = 1 / units.second # unit: s^-1

# --- Resistance Operator ---

# Damping term proportional to movement
k = var('k') # damping coefficient (unit: s^-1)
R = -k * M # -k * dP/dt
R_units = 1 / units.second # unit: s^-1

# --- Cosmological Term ---
Lambda = var('Lambda')
Lambda_units = 1 / (units.second^2) # unit: s^-2 (same as LHS)
