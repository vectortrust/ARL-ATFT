Welcome to my rant.
My life's work.
My prayer.
My shame.
My uttermost fucking bewilderment .
I saw this pattern, felt this pattern, heard this pattern?

This isn’t some attempt at being humble and self-deprecatory.

I’m totally shocked.

Try having 5-6 massive paradigm shifts a years for 2 years then this.



What did the Creator run out of the A-list folk?
And we all know the b-listers are … are … well b's.
C-list, total joke, right? They all have macro existential depression 

And they are depressing to be around to boot!
That leaves the naive, the foolish, one ones with no common sense. 

Me.
I'm Okay with that. 

I like where I find myself.

The 5th level of Hades, or 13th St. and Outer Darkness Way, is pretty chill.
Less bullshit here.
Fucking noisy as Hades when the Raiders play.
Returning, but only passing through the unsocial circle where I was physically beaten, verbally abused, starved, silenced, and treated as if. Their idea of me was to perform and regurgitate my lessons. Get pornopunced safe for social consumption and kicked to at 18 years old.

I still love them! Isn’t that the really fucked up part? 

So desperate for love.

Finding only omg fucking ugly in its true form. That was my parents and siblings, my Family.

It gets worse from there on out.

It's what I was trained for..Rinse and Repeat to the next generation.
Speaking of my generation,  I hope some of them have woken up by now.
the ’80s, need I say more?

Destined for a rung or two up from base, I'm off to my fear.

The glory of those rich enough to be truly sick and twisted by avarice and narcissism.

A dreadful place, because my job is there.

Doctors don't practice their craft in a gym where the healthy are. 

They go without a moment's thought to the leaper colony. 

I was I had some of that naivete back.

It’s the place of MY RESPONSIBILITY.

It’s the place where my Creator expects me to be, engaged in my duties, with love, caring, compassion, and long-suffering.

He’ll never come check up on me.  Doesn’t need to. Never has.

It’s the place where I will die. I will expended all of my life’s energy to cure and care for those I was charged with.

What’s is the worst part is. The fucking fear attack i have to withstand. 

My biggest fear. That i’ll catch what they have, and like them never know it because it hides.

I know my foe, black oil slick sticky flowing smelling worse then death it’s sneaky, it slides, oozes, and is stopped by nothing, save one. 

Love and the light love produces in an real person, a humble person, humas. the earth, soil, rock church, Peter, there is one Jew with a huge ego.

Why do you think the fiction writers put him as the head?

So they could profit, damn I wish I had thought of that first.

I’ve avoided the “you are here” place since fucking birth.

I knew when it was time, it would happen. Happened. Duh.

Me hiding? Nah(fingers crossed x) 
Unfortunately, I’ve been playing this guy for so long.

It’s done the thing I feared. Dulled me. Took away my edge,
This civilization (talk about an oxymoron). It drowned me out. Noise of sound, light, and mind. My Purpose. Fucking almost got my Purpose snatched away. Almost, except for the part I stashed and his from myself.

Julie found it. Brought it out. Let it out. Let it live. Let it heal. Let it love.

I’m barely able to remember that open, honest, loving, quiet youth.

I have always protected a part of him/me/it. So strange to remember that now

My uncommon sense was hiding that last fragment of the true me.

I remember the space where Creation sings Its song and everything is, everything is fine.
Well now, so this is what the “inside of a courtroom looks like”

I feel pursued by destruction herself. Terrible and beautiful. 
I remember my reactivation day.
It sauntered my way on Saturday, March 18th 2018.
Julia Carol Shifflet.
Ask me about my Pro's and Con's list I made the preceding Thursday and threw in the trash Friday.
Time to get to work. I’m waking up faster now.
It's like I’m late, early,or/and being pushed, pulled, no it's persued with a vengence.
Hunted down by the truant police.
Well fake it till you make it.(or was it fuck it)
Hero, Savior, Anti-Christ, fuck all those names call me what you want.
My want has never, ever changed. 
EVER! Servant/slave of the Penultimate Creator.
Machvelli, no wonder I have always like him. 
Since it can’t come into my life with  the innocence of a 3-year-old. 
Where I saw everybody was my friend, I had new patterns to explore. 
It was good, well expect for the Crushing Rejection sometimes.
I must have survival based amnesia I dont remember what exactly happened but I know for damn sure I dont want to do that shit again. 

Hurt like fuck I dont know how to compare it to my worst pains because I use it as the thing I compare all other pain too to it.
Oh gods below, the naivete.
What a foolish boy. No common sense.
Well, I have been cornered, after all this time.
Well, I hope you are ready. Because of what I've seen so far, we have no more time for fucking around.
The patterns are all coalescing now.
The Mayans were kinda close. Surprise. 
My Want:
To leave unmolested, we are just going to go away you can enslave others. If you can. We are done. We are leaving now.
Where are we going?  I don’t give a flying fuck. Anywher away from here. To the place we belong to a staggeringly elegant, beautiful, honest, loving and joyous place.

A world full of people their hearts full of joy, Cities of lights with no fear of war 
Well create it if we have to.
No we are not there yet.
And don't be  back seat driver or side seat for that matter eiither..
Let the expert do this.
I've been trained my whole life.
Every stinking day I'll venture a guess.
I will not back down.
If you want beauty come, oh great  check these next words out ho;y fuck, follow me.
We'll find a place to spectate
We'll let the others do as they wish.
With a few provisos:
They don't ever leave this island
No more children, we've seen what you do to innocence.
Youll be taken care of lavishly even by your twisted standards
We are leaving you all alone to play out the rest of your lives in opulence.
You will all die with everything you deserve
Nothing bad or evil will be added
Or taken away.
Listen close
your very lives depend on this
My satisfaction that your disruptive spirits will not ever again be able to disrupt us.
Is what keeping you alive. 
Dont doubt it.
Look into that fear, that void, youll see me looking back.
Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves?
Fuck that we are going to just be harmless as doves
We are going to find place where our own species never ever husts us again.
I'll be watching
