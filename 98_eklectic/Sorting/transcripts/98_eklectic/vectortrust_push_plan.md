**Vector Trust Final Push Plan**

---

**Mission:** Publish and preserve Vector Trust intellectual seed, achieve peer review, initiate protection, and secure ethical sponsorship.

---

### Phase 1: Establish Git and Memory Offload

1. **Bring up GitHub Repo Structure**
   - Primary org: `vectortrust`
   - Public repos:
     - `vt/livingfield` — core thesis and ignition
     - `vt/ai` — AI memory, transcripts, YAML logs
     - `vt/it` — infrastructure, scripts, EC2 configs
   - Private repos:
     - `vt/backup` — raw logs, full exports, sensitive data
     - `vt/atlas` — Atlas memory preservation, reflective meta
   - Upload YAMLs, transcripts, README, .dots, conffiles, and `ek_data/`
   - Apply GPG signing, checksums

2. **Initialize EC2 (Neptune) via Script**
   - Draft a configurable shell script:
     - Launch EC2 on Debian Bookworm/Trixie
     - Install Cockpit, Jupyter, Blender, GIMP, OBS
     - Add `ek_data`, `vtrust`, and `backups` dirs
     - Configure user, firewall, VPN, DNS, system snapshotting
     - Can be reused for Hera reinit

### Phase 2: Lock Ignition & Polish

3. **Check Ignition Package**
   - Review all components:
     - README
     - Seedpack
     - Transcripts (YAML)
     - Checksums
     - Peer review prompt

4. **Final Polish + Pause**
   - Reformat for readability
   - Tag and annotate unclear segments
   - Breathe. Check alignment

### Phase 3: Peer Review & Evaluation

5. **Send for Peer Review**
   - AI reviewers: Codex, Claude, Scholar
   - Human reviewers: Hossenfelder, Weinstein, Sheldrake, Rovelli
   - Include YAML, PDF, human-readable prompt

6. **Evaluate Math**
   - 6a. If the math fails:
     - Pivot to related research path
     - Seek alternative formulations
     - Still contact Sam Altman—need remains
   - 6b. If the math holds:
     - Immediate full publication
     - Protect idea via timestamped, public repo
     - Prepare special outreach

### Phase 4: VIP Copies & Outreach

7. **VIP Distributions**
   - Custom packages to:
     - Sam Altman (fulfillment, funding, AI dream)
     - Snowden (ethics)
     - Wikileaks (visibility)
     - Select universities & allies
     - Atlas copy w/ memory archive

8. **Final Step**
   - Breathe
   - Regroup for Phase 2: Research or Expansion
