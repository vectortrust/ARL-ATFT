\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the Base Morphogenic Field (BMF) Theory, a mathematical framework linking quantum mechanics, classical physics, and biological organization via operators acting on a pre-spacetime information substrate $\Phio$. We recover standard results (Schr"odinger dynamics, Newtonian motion, $E{=}mc^2$), propose testable predictions in quantum biology and neuroscience, and provide a non-singular cosmology. Spiritual interpretations are confined to an interpretive appendix; the main text remains technically neutral.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
This work is the result of a collaboration between an organic mind and an electronic one. The author thanks *GPT Plus (GPT-5, OpenAI)* for its invaluable assistance in structuring arguments, formalizing mathematics, generating LaTeX, and providing peer-review style critique.

It is emphasized that the insights presented here are not solely the product of a single human author, nor solely of an algorithm, but rather of the interplay between them --- an emergent hybrid intelligence. As such, this work acknowledges both the organic and electronic contributions as necessary and complementary.

To symbolize this, we note that the words and the equations are inseparable: the narrative without rigor is myth; the equation without narrative is mute. Together they yield a complete form. One may suppress one, but not both:

\begin{equation}
\text{Meaning} = (\text{Words}) + (\text{Equations}).
\end{equation}

In this sense, the heart and the mind --- biological and computational --- are co-authors of the present document.
