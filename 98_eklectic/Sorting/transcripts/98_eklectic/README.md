- A request for **peer review** and **global collaboration**

## Purpose

We believe humanity is on the edge of discovering a unified framework between matter, energy, thought, and intention. This repository is an archive of that pursuit. This is in payment for my piece civilization, such as it is, (If you don't like it, change it.) It's my hope that this work is grounded in love of all  truth, and integrity.

## Project Status - W.I.P.
