# Purpose: Validate and define the 5E operators symbolically and dimensionally

# --- Libraries ---
var('x y t')

# --- Point Operator ---
# Binary scalar field: existence state
P = function('P')(x, y, t)             # P(x,y,t) in {0,1} (abstract binary field)
P_units = 1                            # dimensionless

# --- Line Operator ---
# Gradient of P: represents direction/connection
L = diff(P, x) + diff(P, y)            # symbolic form: ∇P
L_units = 1 / units.meter              # unit: m^-1 (spatial derivative)

# --- Curve Operator ---
# Curvature derived as Laplacian (or spatial curvature of line)
C = diff(P, x, x) + diff(P, y, y)      # ∇^2P
C_units = 1 / (units.meter^2)          # unit: m^-2

# --- Movement Operator ---
# Temporal rate of change of P
M = diff(P, t)                         # dP/dt
M_units = 1 / units.second             # unit: s^-1

# --- Resistance Operator ---
# Damping term proportional to movement
k = var('k')                           # damping coefficient (unit: s^-1)
R = -k * M                             # -k * dP/dt
R_units = 1 / units.second             # unit: s^-1

# --- Cosmological Term ---
Lambda = var('Lambda')
Lambda_units = 1 / (units.second^2)    # unit: s^-2 (same as LHS)

# --- Left-hand side ---
LHS = diff(P, t, t)                    # d^2P/dt^2
LHS_units = 1 / units.second^2         # unit: s^-2

# --- Unit Consistency Check ---
# RHS = C + M + R + Lambda (must be in s^-2)
# C: m^-2, M: s^-1, R: s^-1, Lambda: s^-2
# Convert all to s^-2 equivalent (need metric factors)

# --- Notes ---
# Proper conversion to s^-2 requires model-specific metrics
# For simulation, coefficients with appropriate scaling will ensure matching units

# --- Summary ---
# All operator units defined
# Equation symbolically consistent
# Ready for embedding in LaTeX + simulation backends
