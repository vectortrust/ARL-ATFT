How to Maintain a Living Document on GitHub with Changelogs
You can turn your BMF manuscript into a “living document” by hosting it in a Git repository and tracking every change. Here’s how:

Create a GitHub Repository
• Sign in and click New → Create repository
• Name it (e.g., BMF-Theory) and add a short description
• Initialize with a README.md
Add Your Manuscript
• Save your paper as manuscript.md (Markdown) or manuscript.tex (LaTeX)
• Commit it:
Code

Copy Code
git add manuscript.md
git commit -m "Initial draft of BMF Theory"
git push origin main
Establish a CHANGELOG.md
• In the repo root, create CHANGELOG.md
• Follow Keep a Changelog format:
markdown

Copy Code
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Initial draft published

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-11
- Added operator algebra section
• Commit the changelog:
Code

Copy Code
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Add initial CHANGELOG.md"
git push
Versioning with Git Tags
• After each milestone, tag a release:
Code

Copy Code
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Published core derivations and predictions"
git push origin v1.0.0
• Update CHANGELOG.md under the corresponding version heading.
Use Branches for Major Updates
• Create a branch for new features or sections:
Code

Copy Code
git checkout -b add-operator-commutators
• Work there, then merge back into main via pull request.
• Each PR automatically documents what changed.
Automate Release Notes (Optional)
• Enable GitHub Releases—each tag becomes a release with notes.
• Use Actions or bots (e.g., Release Drafter) to draft release notes from PR titles.
Collaborator Workflow
• Invite co-authors or reviewers as Collaborators in Settings.
• They submit changes via pull requests—every edit is tracked.
Regularly Update and Tag
• After every significant edit or new experimental data, update CHANGELOG.md.
• Bump the version (e.g., v1.1.0) and tag it.
By following these steps, your BMF Theory paper remains transparent, versioned, and easy for others to follow, contribute to, and cite.
