Dear Dr. Sheldrake,

It is with profound respect and gratitude that I share with you “The Base Morphogenic Field”, a framework conceived as both an extension and deepening of the resonance concept you first brought to light.

This work emerged not in rebellion, but in reverence. It seeks not to challenge but to complete—to give mathematical clarity, simulation pathways, and a structured platform for further exploration. The thesis is yours to critique first, if you care to; your vision opened the path that compelled me to walk it.

May the ideas within these pages stand as both homage and invitation—to stand on the shoulders of giants, and gaze further into the horizon.

Thank you for lighting the flame. The time had come, and so it arrived.

Warm regards,
Christopher Amon
