Overview of Morphogenesis in Biology

Morphogenesis refers to the biological processes that control the shape, structure, and spatial distribution of cells, tissues, and organisms. This field integrates molecular biology, genetics, developmental biology, and biophysics to explain how living forms develop complex structures from simpler origins. Core areas of study include gene regulatory networks, cell signaling pathways, mechanical forces in tissue formation, and computational modeling of pattern development. The research often spans from embryonic development in animals and plants to tissue regeneration and organoid engineering. Recent advances emphasize the interplay between biochemical signals and physical mechanics, leveraging live imaging, genetic engineering, and AI-based modeling to better understand morphogenetic principles.
