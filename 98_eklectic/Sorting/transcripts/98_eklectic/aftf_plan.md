      # Base Morphogenic Field Theory
      ## Mathematical Framework for Foundational Reversion
      
      Author: Christopher Amon
      
      ### Abstract
      This repository contains the complete mathematical framework for the Base Morphogenic Field (BMF) theory, proposing that all reality consists of 5 fundamental operators acting on a base morphogenic field.

# Notes for AI assistant
ai_instructions: |
  Create a robust Python/Bash installation script that:
  1. Detects the operating system and package manager
  2. Installs all required tools in the correct order
  3. Handles dependencies and potential conflicts
  4. Creates the project structure
  5. Sets up a Python virtual environment
  6. Provides clear progress feedback
  7. Includes error handling and rollback
  8. Generates a final verification report
  
  The script should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times) and provide options for partial installation if some tools are already installed.
  
  Priority order: Git -> Python -> Python packages -> Graphics tools -> Optional tools
  
  Include a --dry-run option to show what would be installed without actually installing.
