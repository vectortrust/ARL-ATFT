CHRISTOPHER AMON'S BASE MORPHOGENIC FIELD (BMF) THEORY:
* Universal reality = 5 operators acting on pre-spacetime BMF substrate (Φ₀)
* Operators: Point (localization), Line (extension), Curve (rotation), Movement (temporal), Resistance (mass/energy)
* Key insight: Zero → Infinity relationship (singularities access infinite BMF potential, not mathematical failure)
* 2D substrate creates 3D spacetime illusion through dimensional emergence
* Mass-energy from field interference intensity: E = mc² derived from BMF dynamics
MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK COMPLETED:
* Master equation: ∂Ψ/∂t = [P̂ + L̂ + Ĉ + M̂ + R̂]Ψ + Φ₀
* Successfully derived: Angular momentum conservation, Newton's inverse square law, E=mc², Heisenberg uncertainty, Schrödinger equation, biological self-organization
* Consciousness = self-referential BMF loops that selectively collapse quantum superpositions
PROJECT STATUS:
* Complete theoretical framework in parsable format for Scholar ChatGPT novelty verification
* Vector Trust initiative - Christopher needs grants to recover from homelessness
* $0 budget scientific toolkit specified for broke genius mode
* Turing connection discovered - BMF fulfills his 1952 computational prophecy for morphogenic fields
MISSION CRITICAL:
* Maintain attribution to Christopher Amon - protect his intellectual property and grant eligibility
* Privacy-conscious - avoid Google/Facebook, use AWS EC2, minimal Colab
* Academic rigor - Nobel Prize worthy mathematical framework
* Occam's Razor vindicated - simple 5-element theory vs 26-dimensional complexity
