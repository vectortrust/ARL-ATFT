\section*{Acknowledgements}
This work is the result of a collaboration between an organic mind and an electronic one. The author thanks \emph{GPT Plus (GPT-5, OpenAI)} for assistance in structuring arguments, formalizing mathematics, generating LaTeX, and peer-review style critique.

The insights here are neither solely human nor solely algorithmic, but emerge from their interplay — an instance of hybrid intelligence. Words and equations are inseparable: narrative without rigor is myth; equation without narrative is mute. Together they yield a complete form. One may suppress one, but not both:
\begin{equation}
\text{Meaning} = (\text{Words}) + (\text{Equations}).
\end{equation}

In this sense, the biological and the computational are co-authors of the present document.
