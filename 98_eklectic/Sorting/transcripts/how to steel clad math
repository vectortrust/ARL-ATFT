📐 How to Steel-clad the Math
1. Canonical Core (ATFT)

Step 1: Gather the 25 equations (your “Base Morphoc Field” operators).

Step 2: Express them consistently in SageMath → LaTeX (done systematically).

Step 3: Identify dependencies (which are definitional, which are dynamical).

Step 4: Extract symmetries & invariants.

2. Construct the Lagrangian

Build the Lagrangian density
L(P,Σ,Λ,R,∂P,… )
L(P,Σ,Λ,R,∂P,…).

Use Euler–Lagrange formalism to derive the dynamical equations.

Verify: resulting E-L equations reproduce (or reduce to) your 25.

Bonus: show special cases → Klein-Gordon, Maxwell, Schrödinger appear as limits.

3. Formal Checks

Dimensional analysis: every term balances.

Conservation laws: identify conserved currents (Noether theorem).

Stability analysis: positivity of Hamiltonian.

4. Link to Device (CMCI)

Show how one of the conserved quantities (coherence, resonance, etc.) corresponds to measurable cross-modal observables.

Device = applied ATFT, not ad hoc invention.
