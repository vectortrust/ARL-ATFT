## Abstract
This work proposes the **Amon–Turing Field Theory (ATFT)**, a unifying framework built on the concept of the **Base Morphoc Field (BMF)**: a pre-material affector underlying matter and interaction. ATFT is formalized in a set of 25 equations describing coherence, resonance, resistance, and curvature. The theory is grounded in variational mechanics with an associated Lagrangian, and extends to applied instrumentation via the **Coherence Modal Cross-Interferometer (CMCI)**.

## Chapter 1. Introduction
- Motivation: unify physics, philosophy, and metaphysics under a single mathematical and experimental framework.
- Hypothesis: a base affector exists prior to matter, guiding its emergence and interactions.
- Goals: (1) formalize ATFT mathematically, (2) derive a Lagrangian underpinning the 25 equations, (3) design and test an applied instrument (CMCI).

---

## Chapter 2. Literature Review
- Physics: field theories, variational principles, unification attempts (Klein–Gordon, Maxwell, Schrödinger, QFT, string theory).
- Signal Processing: coherence, cross-spectral density, tensor decomposition.
- Philosophy/Theology: pre-material essence, affector concept, metaphysical interpretations.

## Chapter 3. Theoretical Framework (ATFT)
### 3.1 Postulates
1. A universal base morphoc field exists, pre-material but causal.
2. Physical interactions emerge as perturbations and resonances within this field.
3. Observable matter and energy are secondary effects of base affector coherence.

### 3.2 The 25 Equations
- Placeholder: **(to be inserted systematically)**
- Categories: curvature, coherence, resistance, resonance, movement, interaction.
- Representations: operators (∇, ∂/∂t), invariants, conserved quantities.

### 3.3 Symmetries & Invariants
- Translation and rotation invariance.
- Coherence conservation (analogous to charge conservation).
- Resonance stability conditions.

## Chapter 4. Variational Foundation
### 4.1 Candidate Lagrangian Density
- Form:
  \[ \mathcal{L} = f(P, \Sigma, \Lambda, R, \partial P, ...) \]

### 4.2 Euler–Lagrange Derivation
- Show recovery of the 25 equations from δL/δP = 0.
- Confirm consistency with Noether’s theorem → conserved currents.

### 4.3 Special Cases
- Reduction to Klein–Gordon.
- Reduction to Maxwell’s equations.
- Reduction to Schrödinger.

## Chapter 5. Predictions
- Existence of cross-modal coherence observable beyond EM spectrum.
- Tensorial separation of overlapping sources across modalities.
- Detectable invariants persisting under shielding.

---

## Chapter 6. Applied Example: CMCI
### 6.1 Design
- Multimodal sensing: coils (magnetic), plates (electric), photodiodes (optical).
- Shielded inside vs. outside differential configuration.
- ADC + SDR acquisition.

### 6.2 Data Pipeline
- Cross-spectral density → coherence matrix.
- Tensor build across (channel × frequency × time × condition).
- HOSVD decomposition for latent factor extraction.

### 6.3 Preliminary Results
- Baseline: mains coherence, SDR carriers.
- Separation: distinct modalities, reduced inside cage.
- Candidate affector coherence signals: cross-modal, shielding-persistent.

## Chapter 7. Implications
- **Physics**: possible unification of known equations under BMF.
- **Engineering**: new class of coherence sensors.
- **Philosophy/Theology**: measurable link to metaphysical concepts of pre-material essence.

## Chapter 8. Future Work
1. Complete canonical set of 25 equations with rigorous notation.
2. Finalize Lagrangian form and variational proof.
3. Upgrade sensors (fluxgate, OPM, interferometer).
4. Publish open-source whitepaper + peer-reviewed article.
5. Explore funding: NSF SBIR, Templeton Foundation, open-science backers.
