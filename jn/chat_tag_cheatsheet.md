# ðŸ§  Symbolic Chat Tag Cheat Sheet
Use these minimal `%x` tags during chat (or in notes) to auto-structure your symbolic research pipeline. They map directly to sections in Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX, markdown files, or todo lists.

## âœ… Usage Examples
```
%t Symbolic resonance is the condition of stabilized form.
e% \Psi = \hat{R}(\hat{M}(\Phi_0)) + \epsilon
%c
def resonance(phi, alpha, epsilon):
    return alpha * morphic_memory(phi) + epsilon
%d Implement operator simulation for \hat{R}
i% Form is resonance crystallized in symbolic structure.
%q What does \hat{M} represent?
a It retrieves memory from the morphic field.
%r Sheldrake, R. (1981). *A New Science of Life*

Keep this visible while working/chatting. Every tag you use is a future code block, paper paragraph, or symbolic glossary entry.
â†’ Works beautifully with Jupyter, `nbconvert`, Pandoc, and regex extractors.
Symbolic cognition starts with symbolic discipline. ðŸŒ€
