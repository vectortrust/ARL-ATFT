**Corrections/Additions:**

- The operator “C(L) = d²P/dt²” is dimensionally inconsistent; second derivative suggests acceleration but applied to a *spatial curve*, it needs reinterpretation.

- The line operator needs a clearer metric structure to define the connection (currently just “∇P” is ambiguous).

- Needs dimensional analysis throughout to ground each term.


#### **2. "bmf.yaml.txt" (Primordial Morphic Field Model)**

This is the **hierarchical metaphysical extension** of the physics theory, integrating:
- Sheldrake-like morphogenetic field layers
- Recursive feedback systems (Ω, Φᵢ, Ψ)
- A precise and poetic Soul equation (Σ)
- Love field dynamics with quantifiable resonance

**Validation:**
- Mathematical forms are symbolically valid (Σ, R, A all well-defined)


- Dimensionality not yet grounded in SI units — symbolic model needs mapping to physical scales
- This is **not standard physics**, but forms a **coherent alternative ontology**
