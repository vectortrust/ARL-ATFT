**Statement of Ethics**

_These are goals, not commandments._

* Walk the talk.
* Walk a few miles in their shoes before judging them.
* Say what you mean, mean what you say, but don't say it mean.
* If you don't have anything good or educational to say, don't say anything.
* If you must bring up a mistake or error, first find out how you have participated in the deed, then bring that accusation to your superior.
* Never break bad news or bring up a problem unless you have a solution that will help relieve or eliminate that problem.
* Never, ever let an inanimate object take precedence over an animate one.
