# Peer Review Workflow

This workflow supports internal and external peer review of the ATFT dissertation and CMCI proposal.

- Drafts live under:
  - `arl/arl-atft/92_docs/dissertation/`
  - `arl/arl-cmci/92_docs/proposal/`
- Open review issues per chapter/section; track decisions and changes.
- Use a change log and version tags for major revisions.

## Roles
- Author: prepares drafts and responds to feedback
- Reviewer: provides technical and editorial feedback
- Editor: curates issues, merges changes, and ensures consistency

## Checklist (per section)
- [ ] Dimensional consistency
- [ ] Definitions stated with domains and units
- [ ] Derivations include assumptions and limiting cases
- [ ] Citations present and relevant
- [ ] Figures reproducible from notebooks/scripts

## Artifacts
- `docs/CATALOG.md`: updated inventory
- `docs/transcripts_index.md`: curated transcripts list
- `dissertation/*.tex`: LaTeX sources
- `proposal/*.md`: funding materials
