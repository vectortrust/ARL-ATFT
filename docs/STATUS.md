# Project Status (ATFT)

- Phase: 1 (Pre-review, internal only)
- Dissertation: scaffolded; writing in progress (operators, variational, derivations outline)
- Math: notebooks under `math/` (operators, lagrangian)
- Modeling/Sim: scripts + notebooks under `modeling/`, `simulations/`
- CMCI: proposal skeleton + processing pipeline (separate repo `arl-cmci`)

Next milestones:
- Fill operators table and self-adjointness notes
- Draft Newton/Schr√∂dinger/uncertainty derivations
- Add symplectic integrator and figure pipeline
