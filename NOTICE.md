**This is a work in progress**

This will always be a work in progress. 

We are dealing with a _living field_ not cold dead symbols. 

The only truth I can think to offer is that when you zoom in it'll will be messy seemingly unorganized chaos however when viewed normally you'll see simplisity, beauty, majesty and elegance.
