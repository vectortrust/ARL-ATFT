ðŸ§° SCENE SETUP
New Project

Open Blender

File â†’ New â†’ General

Delete default cube (X)

Set Units (optional)

Scene Properties â†’ Units â†’ Metric (or None if more abstract)

Set World color to very dark gray (like interstellar void)

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECT 1: Christopher's Field (Toroid A)
Add a Torus

Shift + A â†’ Mesh â†’ Torus

Radius Major = 1.5

Radius Minor = 0.3

Move slightly left: G â†’ X â†’ -2

Modifiers

Add Subdivision Surface (2-3 levels)

Add Simple Deform â†’ Twist â†’ Angle = 720Â°

Optional: Add a Lattice if you want to warp it later

Material

New Material â†’ Dark Base with Gold Emission edges

Use a mix of Glossy + Emission

Add wave texture â†’ plug into Emission Strength for pulsing pattern

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECT 2: Julieâ€™s Field (Toroid B)
Duplicate Torus A

Select â†’ Shift + D â†’ G â†’ X â†’ +4

Slightly increase minor radius to 0.4

Soften the twist (maybe 540Â°) for gentler curves

Material

Warm pastel glow (pink-peach base, golden white Emission)

Add noise texture to give it shimmer, like energy dancing

ðŸ”— OBJECT 3: Shared Resonance Bridge (Î£â‚ƒ)
Add a Curve

Shift + A â†’ Curve â†’ Bezier

Go to edit mode (Tab)

Shape it to arc between the toruses

Add more points if needed (Subdivide in right-click menu)

Convert to Tube

Curve settings â†’ Geometry â†’ Bevel â†’ Depth = 0.05

Add resolution (12+) to smooth

Material

Glowing bridge

Transparent shader mixed with Emission

Animate Emission strength over time for pulse effect

(Optional): Use a sine wave modifier on Z-axis for subtle vibration

âš« OBJECT 4: Zero Collapse Point (Singularity)
Add UV Sphere

Radius 0.1

Place between toroids at midpoint

Material = Full black, glassy, maybe with halo

Animate Scale

Frame 1: Scale = 0.1

Frame 60: Scale = 0.01 (as if collapsing to zero)

Then frame 90: Scale = 5.0 â€” simulate the Î© burst

ðŸŒŒ OBJECT 5: Î© FIELD (Source)
Add Sphere (Icosphere or UV Sphere)

Radius = 8

Place around all objects

Material = Glass, 50% transparency

Add fractal noise texture to give it living skin

Optional: Add subtle displacement modifier

With cloud texture to make it shimmer like energy folding back

ðŸŽ¥ CAMERA + LIGHTING
Camera

Position front-left of toroids

Add keyframes for gentle orbit over 250 frames

Use "Track To" constraint targeting singularity object

Lighting

1 HDRI (world node) for ambient cosmic light

2 Point Lights inside toroids, color-matched to materials

Subtle bloom enabled in Render â†’ Eevee Settings

ðŸ’¥ FINAL TOUCHES
Use the Graph Editor to animate emission pulses

Set toroids to rotate in opposite directions (slow spin)

Add soundtrack laterâ€”low-frequency harmonic hum to simulate resonance
