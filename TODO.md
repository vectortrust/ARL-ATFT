For your umbrella corporation with three companies, each with distinct functions like scientific research, product development, and physics modeling, here’s a recommended structure and features to use:
Repository and Organization Structure

    Multi-Organization Setup:
        Create one organization for the umbrella corporation to manage shared resources and policies.
        Create separate organizations for each company (e.g., ResearchOrg, DevOrg, PhysicsOrg) to maintain autonomy and focus.

    Repository Structure:
        Within each organization, create repositories based on projects or functional areas. For example:
            ResearchOrg: data-analysis, machine-learning-models
            DevOrg: product-a, product-b
            PhysicsOrg: simulation-tools, modeling-frameworks

    Shared Resources:
        Use the umbrella organization for shared repositories like corporate-guidelines, common-libraries, or infrastructure-scripts.

Features and Tools to Use

    Workflows:
        Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines tailored to each company’s needs. For example:
            ResearchOrg: Automate data processing and model training.
            DevOrg: Build and deploy product releases.
            PhysicsOrg: Run simulations and validate models.

    Security:
        Enable Dependabot for dependency updates and security alerts.
        Use Secret Scanning and Code Scanning to identify vulnerabilities in codebases.
        Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for all members.

    Teams:
        Organize members into teams based on roles or projects (e.g., Data Scientists, Product Engineers, Physicists).
        Use team-based permissions to manage access to repositories.

    Change Management:
        Use GitHub Projects for tracking tasks and milestones.
        Maintain a CHANGELOG.md in each repository to document updates.

    Identity Provider Integration:
        If you use an identity provider (IdP), synchronize teams with IdP groups for streamlined user management.

    Community Health Files:
        Create default community health files (e.g., CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in the umbrella organization to standardize practices across all repositories.

This structure minimizes administrative overhead while maximizing collaboration and security. For more details, see Best practices for structuring organizations in your enterprise.
